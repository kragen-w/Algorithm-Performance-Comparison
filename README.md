# Algorithm-Performance-Comparison


This program creates three fucntions that all use different algorithms to find if a list contains both a negative and positive
version of the same integer. Alg 1 checks every integer against every ineger to find this, and this is very slow. Alg 2 uses a 
binary search algorithm, and it is much faster. Alg 3 uses another algorithm, which is 10 times faster than Alg 2. Then, the program 
outputs how long each function takes to completly search a list with increasing input sizes, and displays the data to the console.
